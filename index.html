<h3>Funny things I do</h3>
<p>The funny things I love to do is to talk silly stories. I talk in a very funny voice and tell silly stories. When I am playing with my friends in Fortnite, we would go to a campfire and talk <em> Scary </em> Stories. I do say scary stories but the ending is just very silly. I have a lot of fun playing with my Friends.</p>
